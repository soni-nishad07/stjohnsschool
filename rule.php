      <p class="rule_sec_intro">
        At St. John's High School, we uphold a culture of discipline, respect, and responsibility to ensure a safe and enriching learning environment for every student. The following regulations must be followed strictly by all students and parents:
      </p>

      <h3 class="rule_sec_subtitle red">General School Rules</h3>
      <ol class="rule_sec_list">
        <li>During school hours, if a student needs to leave the premises, they must obtain permission from the class teacher, along with written approval from the coordinator, Principal, or Administrator.</li>
        <li>Punctuality and regular attendance are compulsory for every student. All students must follow the official holiday calendar. Extending holidays for unofficial or vague reasons is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Leave of absence must be requested in writing to the Principal in advance. The request should clearly state the dates and reason for the leave, student’s name, and the contact numbers of the parents.</li>
        <li>Class tests and internal assessments must be taken on or before the specified due dates. The school cannot entertain any requests for delays, waivers, or extensions.</li>
        <li>Students are expected to return to class on the date declared before and after every vacation. A penalty of ₹5.00/- per day is charged for being late without a valid medical reason.</li>
        <li>All belongings such as books, cardigans, bags, and shoes must be labeled clearly with the student’s name, class, and section. Lost and found items will be kept in the school office. The school is not responsible for any lost property.</li>
        <li>A minimum of 90% attendance is mandatory for every academic year.</li>
        <li>It is compulsory for every student to complete their homework daily. Parents are requested to sign the entries in the school diary and check the ‘Remarks’ column regularly for important notes from the teachers.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 class="rule_sec_subtitle red">Disciplinary Guidelines</h3>
      <p>Strict disciplinary action will be taken against any student involved in the following behaviors:</p>
      <ul class="rule_sec_bullets">
        <li>Misbehavior in the classroom or on any part of the school premises</li>
        <li>Violent behavior or harming other students</li>
        <li>Use of abusive or inappropriate language</li>
        <li>Bullying or ragging</li>
        <li>Disregarding school or library rules</li>
        <li>Damaging school property</li>
        <li>Wearing incorrect uniform</li>
        <li>Violating the dress code</li>
        <li>Causing repeated disruptions in the classroom</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="rule_sec_subtitle orange">Important Notice</h3>
      <p>If any student fails to follow the school’s rules and regulations, the school reserves the right to cancel the student’s admission with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>Parents are requested to thoroughly review these rules and cooperate with the school to maintain discipline and a conducive learning environment.</p>

      <h3 class="rule_sec_subtitle blue">Discipline Monitoring</h3>
      <p>A Discipline Register is maintained by the respective subject heads. If misconduct is reported, the student will receive a warning and their behavior will be closely monitored. Persistent misbehavior will lead to a parent notification. In extreme cases, the student may face suspension or expulsion.</p>
      <p>We believe that maintaining discipline is a shared responsibility. The school appreciates the continued support and cooperation of all parents.</p>
